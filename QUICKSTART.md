```env
# Your folder ID from Step 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id_here

# Your API key from Step 2
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# The entire JSON file contents from Step 3 as ONE LINE
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"diwali-uploader@...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
```

**IMPORTANT for GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY:**
- Open the downloaded JSON file
- Copy the **entire contents**
- Make it a single line (remove all newlines)
- Paste it after the `=`

### Quick way to format the JSON:
```bash
# In terminal, run this (replace 'downloaded-file.json' with your actual filename):
cat ~/Downloads/your-service-account-file.json | tr -d '\n'
```
Then copy the output and paste it into .env.local

## Troubleshooting

**"Gallery not loading"**

- Make sure folder is public ("Anyone with the link")
- Check browser console for errors

**"Upload not working"**
- Make sure service account has Editor access to the folder
- Verify the JSON in .env.local is valid (no newlines in the middle)
- Check server logs in terminal

**"API key invalid"**
- Make sure you enabled Google Drive API
- Check the API key is restricted to only Drive API
- Try creating a new API key
